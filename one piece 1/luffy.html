      Monkey D. Luffy, also known as " Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw
      Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the
      founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat
      Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters. His lifelong dream is to
      become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by
      the late Gol D. Roger. He believes that being the Pirate King means having
      the most freedom in the world.
