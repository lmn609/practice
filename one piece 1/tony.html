      Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper, is the
      doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the sixth member of the crew and
      the fifth to join, doing so at the end of the Drum Island Arc. He was
      temporarily forced to join the Foxy Pirates during the Long Ring Long Land
      Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.
